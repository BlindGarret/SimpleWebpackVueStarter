# Webpack Vue Starter

A simple Webpack Starter template for Vue.JS. This is heavily based on nnupoor's Webpack template. I have simply stripped out some components when I was running through learning how to setup Webpack and Vue together. I will continue tweaking it and upgrading it as I continue teaching myself Vue.

If you would like to see the original repo I based this off of please goto:
